Here is an example of a disabled widget.

Any widget that is "Disabled" will not show up on your site.

You can use it to store widgets that you make, but maybe don't want to use at the moment.

You could also disable but keep the sample widgets in case you want to reference them later.

You can safely delete this file, as it serves no real purpose now that you know these things.
